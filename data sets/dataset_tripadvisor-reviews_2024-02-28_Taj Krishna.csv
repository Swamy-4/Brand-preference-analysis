Keep continuing the good work ahead.
Experience of Excellence,5,2024-02,20-02-2024,"I started writing this feedback with ""My stay at Taj Krishna..."" but deleted it as I don't think it was a mere stay and feedback of how comfortable the rooms were, and how good the food was. It cannot be about what I liked and didn't like too. It is the Taj, They are for sure top-notch.
Once you enter the premises of Taj Krishna, Hyderabad, take that U-turn from the signal before its main entrance while coming from a long-delayed flight and a cab ride of about 50 minutes from the airport it is a whole different world. You don't experience the hospitality after you check in to your room or when you reach the reception. It starts from the very main entrance. The environment just after the main entrance is an invitation to the excellence of everything we will experience. The entrance to the main lobby, how the luggage was handled, everything had a touch of care. Check-in was smooth and was made easy with the booking, but the way we were welcomed was as if they were waiting for us only. Small little details are what make the big difference in any business sector and that was there. My father and mother were traveling with me and they appreciated every one of them. I would like to thank Megha, Mohith, and Vincent for taking care of those small details. I have been welcomed at multiple hotel lobbies with some garlands, bouquets, welcome drinks, and even the kumkum tilak on my forehead. I was welcomed here with a tilak on my forehead but what was accompanying it was nice. Megha put that tilak and said ""It is for your good health"" 
We had our dinner at Firdaus, well almost all the main meals, lunch and dinner, there only and the team of Mr. Kenneth Reddy, Farhat, Jennifer, Manas, G. L. Reddy and the chefs who were behind the food that were served made us feel to come back again during any stay at Taj. 
Rather than feedback, I would like to call it a thank-you note to all of you!"
A day in taj krishna,4,2024-02,20-02-2024,"The atmosphere at taj Krishna was amazing and the food is delight.

Delighted,5,2024-02,14-02-2024,"Greetings to the Taj Krishna family.

My visit to Taj Krishna on 11-Feb-2024 was a delight..
Having spent my anniversary at Taj Krishna was such an amazing experience.
The Hotel so very well maintained by the Taj team in every aspect shows why it's a member of the leading hotel of the world.
The associates pamper you from the porch itself with the most amazing smile that brightens the day,makes one feel that this stay with them is going to be a delight.
The traditional way of welcoming has been going on since my first visit in 2010 and 14 years later also still continues.
The tilak and the Tulsi mala welcoming is by far the best.
The delight factor was the lead bazar chuda given by the team to my wife just brought the biggest smile on smile on her.
My wife and I were treated with utmost care by the front desk team Mr.Vincent, Ms.Megha, Ms.Mamta,and Mr.Mohith.
Escorting us to our room and reassuring to extend all their services.
Decorating our room with flowers petals,a delicious chocolate cake (my all time favourite) and the swans made with towels.
All these there were the most amazing gestures that made me feel so delighted.
The team at encounters and seasons bar made sure we were seated and suggested with the best of their delicacies.
Celebrating my dinner with the team was a delight.
The turn down service (from placing tiny bits of the most amazing inhouse crafted chocolates and cleaning my room again and making sure I have the best and most comfortable sleep.
In every way Taj Krishna Hyderabad has delivered the most beautiful experience.
Kudos to the team who made my stay so memorable.

Excellent well run hotel,5,2024-02,06-02-2024,"We stayed in the Taj Krishna for three nights for tourism. The hotel seems have a mix of tourists and business travelers (more of the latter). I found the staff uniformly helpful and efficient. Our room was well appointed with a comfortable bed, a decent view of the beautiful grounds, and good quality fixtures. Nice bathroom with excellent water pressure and plenty of hot water.

We had three breakfasts here and found the staff very courteous. A specific waiter took care of us each day and by the second day he knew exactly how we liked our coffee etc - small touches that leave a pleasant impression. I mostly had the Indian items and my wife had mostly the western items - everything was great with plenty of choice. We had dinner one night in the Chinese restaurant- superlative food and service.
Next time I am in Hyderabad I would stay here again."

Excellent staff service,5,2024-01,05-02-2024,I frequent visit Taj krishna for my business trip and really love the service and the staff here is very sweet and hospitable. I also want to thank and appreciate Mr Aviyash for his service and his excellent hospitality during my recent visit. He was really sweet and very kind. Keep up the good job. All the best.
Aviyash from IRD is a superstar,5,2024-01,05-02-2024,"THANK YOU Aviyash from inroom dining!!! You are a gem! You made me and my roommate feel so well taken care of after we arrived at 2am and asked for food. Checking on our well being, ensuring he set up the food trolley comfortably so that we didn’t have to move from our beds to eat knowing how exhausted we were. He was sympathetic to our work hours and requirements and the way he spoke to us and took care of us reminded us of going back home to family after being away for a long time. 
Thank you once again! :)"
Lovely stay as always,5,2024-02,05-02-2024,Mr Karim and Mr Jatin were exceptional in their services.They made our stay and dinning experience wonderful.They were quick with the services and very humble and polite with all the guests around the dinner...........Hope to visit soon..
an oasis of quiet from the traffic and honking but hotel could give more attention to several avoidable irritants,4,2024-01,04-02-2024,"The hotel and its grounds offer an oasis of quiet from the traffic and attendant honking.  The hotel's public areas, its grounds and the garden are lovely; the swimming pool area offers a pleasant, relaxing atmosphere; the  restaurants are good; the restaurant and reception staff are warmly attentive and responsive; and our room on the 8th floor was comfortably spacious an, though facing the main road, was well insulated from the sound.   All in all, we had a good stay.  There is, however, a systematic lack of attention to details that prevents me from scoring the hotel higher.  

The most aggravating of the lot was the passive concierge.  We wanted to make a restaurant reservation at the other Taj (Falaknuma).  Most hotel groups have internal processes for assisting guests from one hotel make reservations at sister hotels and normally, the concierge is the person to speak to.  Most concierge that we have encountered - in India and elsewhere - are right on top of such things...making every effort to sort things out.  Not here.  We started the process the day before in the morning -- and in spite of repeated promises that we would be informed in 1 hour, in 2 hours, soon, hours passed, the entire day passed and the night passed.  There seemed to be no sense of urgency.   By that time our reservation was confirmed -- 24 hours later, in the morning on the day of, we had given up and made a reservation at our second choice lest we lose out on both.   This type of lackadaisical attitude is not something some would expect from a Taj Hotel. 

In the room, there are electrical sockets on one side of the bed but not the other.  In this day and age when nearly everyone carries a smart phone and these serve, among other things, as a clock/alarm, most people want to charge their phones overnight on the nightstand next to the bed.  Only one of us was able to do that.

The bathroom lacked sufficiently bright lights around the mirror, especially lights directed at the individual.  With our faces in shadows, it was difficult to put on make up or shave.  Lights should be placed to illuminate the individual, not the sink top or alternatively, please install magnifying make-up mirrors with a light.   The water spray is generally located on the right side of the toilet -- for obvious reasons.  Here, it was on the left.  It just seemed like someone had bothered to think through these little details that are nonetheless important.  And finally, the bathtub was all scratched up -- so badly that at first glance, it looked filthy.  Regardless, it was definitely not enticing."

Staff were friendly and helpful, especially Yasimi. She is a problem solver and always pleasant. Great food and excellent choice at the buffet. We were honoured to be invited to be part of the flag raising ceremony for Republish Day. Thank you.
 
My only niggle is the pigeons hanging around the outdoor restaurant. They are always ready to dive onto a table and when no one is seated they walk all round the tables/plates and the staff store station. Twice they dropped poo near us. They management need to be move active in getting rid of them or get some dummy hawks in place."

Good star property,4,2024-01,15-01-2024,"Good property located in Banjara Hills road no 1, just opposite to city centre mall and walkable distance from GVK1 mall. Warm reception was provided to all the guest. Rooms are spacious with all amenities. Restaurant is congested due to space constraints. Breakfast buffet spread is good. Dinner buffet spread is also good, but not worth for the charges of 3000 rupees including GST. Function hall is available in the ground floor and the sound is a disturbance to the guest staying in rooms. Not worth for spending 15000+ rupees for a night stay and dinner though facilities the are good."

Also  a great exhibition show was on for clothes and fashion , where I bought 2 outfits.

Only thing that marred our stay was that we upgraded to club, however, there was no access to club lounge, which we were suprised, as we have been offered club access in other taj hotels such as taj bengal and taj lands end.

Probably a very nice hotel at one time,3,2023-12,22-12-2023,"If I had to describe the Taj Krishna in one word, that word would be ""dingy."" The Taj really seems like it was a nice hotel 20 or 30 years ago, but today, it's dated, musty, and desperately in need of renovation. The traffic noise was also somewhat disruptive. Overall, the service was good, if a little clingy and overbearing at times. The food was also decent, especially the Chinese restaurant. I would consider staying again, but only after a large-scale modernization effort."
