Somewhat satisfied,3,2024-01,09-02-2024,"The staff here is very good , I have got a lot of help from Sai Kiran ,Sazzad, Dashral, Simran, Sarita, Hemant and  Rupesh . Service wise the hotel is nice . But the food is not so good . Also the infrastructure of hotel is very old it seems . 
Lifts don't to the nor the stairs . Every time you park your vehicle you have to come up by climbing in a 30 degree ram ,while going down also you need to do the same . 
House keeping staff again is very nice but again the rooms are comparatively smaller in size then the other hotel in the same range . 
Also every time you want extras like shaving kit or slippers you have ask for it . 
They don't keep it in ."
Average Experience,3,2024-02,09-02-2024,"Pros : 
-	Close location to companies in HiTec City
-	Good connectivity by Metro and skywalks
-	Good variety in Breakfast and dinner options . Ala Carte also very well made 
-	Rooms were clean and had all necessary requirements
-	Bathrooms, AC and worktable very clean and good to use

Cons: 
-	TV did not work, had just one channel
-	Difficult to get hold of the hotel reception. As my flight was moved to next day, I called multiple numbers provided to talk to someone for late checkout info. I was transferred 2-3 times and finally told to send an email. I sent an email, and the reply was “noted” with no solution or answers
-	I booked through MakeMyTrip for 2 days, due to flight moved up, I asked for a day’s extension in same room, offering to pay right there during check-in. I was told I need to book a separate day through MMT. I found that very impractical and illogical. I was right there; they could have taken a separate transaction and took payment for both our ease. I had to login and book a separate day paying certain amount more to third party
-	3 days during breakfast I was disturbed while having food to take a survey, almost at point of badgering. I kept telling them I will take it later, they insisted to take it after I finish food. One of them also ran behind me to mention I need to take it right then as he must take a photo of the survey result. I took it under duress. Surveys need to be genuine and not under pressure or scrutiny 
-	Out of curiosity I didn’t go to my usual Hotels with membership and went here to start a membership, did not meet my expectations"

Really rude,1,2024-01,29-01-2024,"After spending two days with lemon tree.
I am sharing my exp with all of you.
Its one of the corporate brand in hospitality. Fir my own company i had booked this brand many times.

But first time i had experienced this horrible or un professional  behaviour from the middle management of lemon tree hitech hyd.

The housekeeping and room staff is really courteous ,where as front office exc and front office duty manager on the date of 29 th jan .1:30 pm.
Had given me really pathetic behaviour .while asking for the extention on stay.
The had behaved as i am asking complimentry room .from them.
There behaviour was really nuisance,
Duty manager was really rude 
By giving instruction ryt in front of me 
""Tell her this is branded property .we are not having any discount over 
She wants to stay she can.
She can check out.""
They made me feel as if i am standing in some road side lodge.
Unfortunately i have to continue the stay due to the sickness of my son.
With the higher amount.

Whereas the time of booking 
It wa clear .if we will extend .we will update u
First nyt i had paid 6700/ for the same room they charged me 12900/

Finances doesn't make pinch me that hard.
The kind of behaviour Bengali girl on the front office and duty manager had made me feel.
 
I am hotelier never behaved in this manner hospitality industry  .

It was really hopeless ."

She has no manners, she doesn't know what's the job of a receptionist is and what the hell a customer is. She shouts at customer for no reason, has no sense of privacy. When I am asking her to speak low, not at all lowering down, i felt like why am I paying 26k for 3 days and still fight with a moron like her. Terrible experience.

To the management of Lemon Tree; you've great building, great infrastructure, fantastic location, but trust me it's all waste when you have people like Priyanka in reception, she made the entire hotel stay of 3 days seem terrible."

The REAL EXPERIENCE of CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!,5,2023-12,01-01-2024,"A nice hotel to stay for business, however I travelled with family and an year old baby… on check in I had mixed feeling about the hotel services however the housekeeping staff was extremely helpful. Gopi ( assistant manager housekeeping)  ensured that my baby keeps safe in the room. He got all the furniture out and did a floor set up for my baby. He ensured that my baby eats first and also informed me that the baby food is complementary in the hotel. I truly believe that the ultimate luxury is in staying at the comfort of your home and not in any star property, however it’s the services of the staff that gives you the feeling of luxury… all that we need is a listener and Gopi from housekeeping was a true listener, calmed me down and did every possible thing to make us comfortable specially my year old baby.  Sadly It’s rare to get extraordinary services in service industry specially in India..only a handful of  people from service industry do understand the real meaning of SERVICE, and m glad I met one of them. Thanks GOPI!!

Loved the services provided by restaurants for in room dining, I used to call them 24*7 for baby food or milk or for that matter washing the bottles for my baby.. chefs are very accommodating and cooked customised lunches and dinners for us and for my baby… extremely polite in house dining staff.. Lipi , Gaurav are a few names that I remember but there are many more in in-house dining.

Overall these are the guys who made me feel comfortable and hence I recommend the hotel to others who are travelling with infants.

Thanks Gopi( housekeeping)Lipi and Gaurav (in house dining)"
