The old retro Supervisor with black coat needs to smile and interact more to guests. In my total 15+ days of stay he is the only guy I never saw speaking to guest or any welcoming gestures from his side to anyone.

Mixed feeling for the stay,4,2023-10,22-10-2023,"I had a pleasant stay at the hotel for two days. The hotel staff were courteous and helpful, especially Raviteja, Jahid, Ajay and Swapna. They made me feel welcome and comfortable. I enjoyed the breakfast and the in-room dining service, which had a variety of dishes and good quality food. However, I was not impressed by the lunch or dinner buffet, which was bland and repetitive. I would suggest improving the buffet menu or offering more options for guests. The only issue I had was that I forgot some important tablets in my room when I checked out. Fortunately, Raviteja was kind enough to accompany me back to the room and retrieve them. I appreciate his professionalism and honesty. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a good value and friendly service."

"Great staff : Jagat chef, koyyada swapna and Venu",5,2023-09,23-09-2023,"Great service and personal care by
 Chef Jagat. Great food. 
Also to mention really great serving and humble nature by Koyyada Swapna and Venu. 
They are so humble and these are the people who make a brand successful. 
Would be great if you promote these staff. They are an asset to your company. 
A suggestion Please don't provide patanjali drinking water. It tarnishes your brand image. Patanjali is a ripoff brand with substandard quality goods. 
Gives an impresssion that your brand is also substandard. The stay was great staff was amazing. Deducting one star with a heavy heart just because of patanjali divya jal. 
I don't need no divya jal . Please provide simple packaged drinking water from a decent brand. 
Love redfox"
